just the notes from my email !!!!!

Hi Amanda,
I just finally got my code uploaded!!,
Here is the repo link:

I am happy to say it was a generally FUN project!!  On the positive side, I think it meets most of the Angular/logic oriented requirements.  On the not quite as positive side, it has runtime issues.
I really didn't have a good idea of how to do charts/graphs, so I thought I would check out goolecharts.  Well it turned out to be quite the detour and odyssy.
Apparently, unless you hardcoded the datapoints, it can be pretty hairy. I tried hacking it 10 ways till tommorrow, thinking I was almost there. And then I got so invested in it, that I couldn't turn back.  At various times, I did have successful calls to the chart service( it is a realtime service and sometimes I think it goes down!!)
And so when it came time to unit test, it was like, hmmm this is a problem.

So what I did get right was:
I did use Angular 2/4
the services works,
mapping class data works,
doing data transformations works,
prefetching data thru a resolver and observables works, 
creating a pipe for array filtering works,
routing works
responsive on the home page works
compiling works

.....so again that graphing part was a major curve ball and I unfortunately ran out of time to  go beyond
just crude html formatting and css on the UI



Yes the pitfalls of using Outside widgetry, but I had fun!!, and it is always good to excercise your debugging skills once in a while.
